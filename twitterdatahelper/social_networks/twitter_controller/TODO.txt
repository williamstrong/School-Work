TwitterData

    Data
        Create files maybe...
        This will ask for data from the DatabaseController and do things with the data
        This will be the access module for creating visuals/examining data for research

    DatabaseController
        _Database.py
            Rename and specify purpose
            Return DB object on instantiation/function calls so that higher level modules can interact with DB
            Create functions for reading data from the DB
            Clean up current DB and migrate/backup data to MongoDB Atlas
            Create helper function to manage Collections
        Read.py
            Add filter functionality
            Add filter types
            Possible new module for filtering (i.e. map reduce and other functions)
        Write.py
            Pretty good for now, but will need added functionality
