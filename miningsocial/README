TO USE: Navigate to this directory and run "vagrant up" in your comand prompt. Vagrant
will install the box and run scripts to set up the virtual machine. This will take a

URL (if your host machine is Windows replace the ip 0.0.0.0 with 127.0.0.1). Navigate to this URL on
your machine. 
Jupyter Notebook requires a password after connecting. This password is: 'csci480'
